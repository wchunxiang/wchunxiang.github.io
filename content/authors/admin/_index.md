      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Chunxiang Wang is a Ph.D. student in robotics at ETH ZÃ¼rich and MPI-IS (about to graduate in Oct. 2025), where he works on miniature medical robotic systems. He earned his B.Eng. and M.Sc. degrees from the Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT) supervised by Prof. Huijun Gao, graduating with a distinguished GPA of 93.75/100. Under the supervision of Prof. Metin Sitti, his research focuses on soft millirobots with novel functionalities, integrating computer vision and closed-loop robotic control. His work has been published in prestigious venues, such as Science Advances and a series of IEEE Transactions. Chunxiang has received numerous accolades, including the Max Planck Fellowship, several top-tier scholarships, and awards for Best Graduation Thesis. He also serves as a peer reviewer for leading journals and international conferences in the field of robotics.
