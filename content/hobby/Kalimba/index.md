The kalimba, also known as the thumb piano, has become one of my favorite ways to unwind and express myself musically. Originating from Africa, this small instrument produces a soft, enchanting sound that's both calming and uplifting.

I was drawn to the kalimba for its simplicity and portability, but what keeps me engaged is the peaceful, meditative quality of its music. Whether I'm learning new songs or improvising my own melodies, playing the kalimba helps me clear my mind and find a moment of stillness in a busy day.

It's not just a hobby—it's a small, joyful ritual that brings harmony into my life.

Videos of my kalimba playing are occasionally uploaded to Bilibili.
