abstract: Implanted electronic sensors, compared with conventional medical imaging, allow monitoring of advanced physiological properties of soft biological tissues continuously, such as adhesion, pH, viscoelasticity, and biomarkers for disease diagnosis. However, they are typically invasive, requiring being deployed by surgery, and frequently cause inflammation. Here we propose a minimally invasive method of using wireless miniature soft robots to in situ sense the physiological properties of tissues. By controlling robot-tissue interaction using external magnetic fields, visualized by medical imaging, we can recover tissue properties precisely from the robot shape and magnetic fields. We demonstrate that the robot can traverse tissues with multimodal locomotion and sense the adhesion, pH, and viscoelasticity on porcine and mice gastrointestinal tissues ex vivo, tracked by x-ray or ultrasound imaging. With the unprecedented capability of sensing tissue physiological properties with minimal invasion and high resolution deep inside our body, this technology can potentially enable critical applications in both basic research and clinical practice.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Wireless miniature soft robots offer a minimally invasive way to continuously monitor physiological properties of soft tissues, like pH and viscoelasticity, by precisely recovering tissue properties from their shape and external magnetic fields.
