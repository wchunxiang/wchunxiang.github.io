abstract: Miniature soft robots offer opportunities for safe and physically adaptive medical interventions in hard-to-reach regions. Deploying multiple robots could further enhance the efficacy and multifunctionality of these operations. However, multirobot deployment in physiologically relevant three-dimensional (3D) tubular structures is limited by the lack of effective mechanisms for independent control of miniature magnetic soft robots. This work presents a framework leveraging the shape-adaptive robotic design and heterogeneous resistance from robot-lumen interactions to enable magnetic multirobot control. We first compute influence and actuation regions to quantify robot movement. Subsequently, a path planning algorithm generates the trajectory of a permanent magnet for multirobot navigation in 3D lumens. Last, robots are controlled individually in multilayer lumen networks under medical imaging. Demonstrations of multilocation cargo delivery and flow diversion manifest their potential to enhance biomedical functions. This framework offers a solution to multirobot actuation benefiting applications across different miniature robotic devices in complex environments.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.

It leverages the robots' shape adaptability and varied resistance from their interaction with the lumen walls, along with a path planning algorithm, to enable applications like multi-location cargo delivery and flow diversion.

### 1. Robot Design and Actuation

* **Shape-Adaptive Stent-Structured Robots:** The robots are designed to be shape-adaptive, allowing navigation through tortuous 3D lumens with a self-anchoring capability to withstand fluid flow. They are constructed from soft materials, ensuring safe biomedical interactions and enabling resistance variation through deformation.
* **Magnetic Actuation with Permanent Magnet (PM):** A translating and rotating permanent magnet (PM) mounted on a 7-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) robotic arm is used for actuation. This method offers advantages such as compactness, heat-free operation, and scalability for human-scale applications, differentiating it from electromagnetic actuation.

### 2. Control Strategy: Influence and Actuation Regions

* **Key Concepts:** The framework introduces two critical regions for quantifying robot movement: the **Influence Region ($\Omega$)**, where the PM induces sufficient torque for robot rotation, and the **Actuation Region ($\Psi$)**, a subset of $\Omega$ where both torque and force exceed resistance thresholds, enabling continuous rotation and translation.
* **Independent Control Mechanism:** Independent control is achieved by strategically positioning the PM within the $\Psi$ of the target robot while ensuring it remains outside the $\Omega$ of already deployed robots to prevent interference. The size and shape of these regions ($\Omega/\Psi$) can be dynamically adjusted based on factors like PM size and orientation, lumen diameter, material stiffness, and fluid flow.

### 3. Resistance Estimation and Path Planning

* **Online Resistance Estimation:** The study details a method for online estimation of resistive torque ($T_{resist_{thr}}$) and force ($F_{resist_{thr}}$) at critical points of robot movement initiation. This involves quantifying resistance based on the magnetic torque and force required to overcome local friction and fluid drag.
* **Path Planning Algorithm:** A path planning algorithm generates the trajectory of the permanent magnet for multirobot navigation through complex 3D lumen networks. It optimizes the deployment order to avoid interference with deployed robots and maximize actuation force on the target robot.

* **Multilayer 3D Lumen Deployment:** The system's efficacy was demonstrated by deploying up to six robots in synthetic and *ex vivo* porcine artery lumens under ultrasound and X-ray imaging, even in dynamic fluid environments with pulsatile flow.
* **Functional Demonstrations:** The framework's potential was showcased through demonstrations of multi-location cargo delivery using robots with PDMS patches and flow diversion by blocking branch lumens with sealed stent cells.
