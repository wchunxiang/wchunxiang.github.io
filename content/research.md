        Chunxiang Wang received his B.Eng. in Automation from Harbin Institute of Technology (2015–2019). From 2018 to 2021, he was with the lab of Prof. Huijun Gao, where he worked on robotic micromanipulation for zebrafish microinjection, participating in the development of 3D calibration, visual feedback, non-invasive object capture, and 3D posture control systems. He also independently developed a multi-object tracking system for zebrafish larvae under high density and occlusions.

        Since 2021, he has been a Ph.D. student in the D-PI at MPI-IS and D-ITET at ETH Zürich. His research focuses on soft millirobots with novel functionalities, integrating computer vision and closed-loop magnetic actuation. His expertise spans soft robot design and fabrication, robot mechanics and magnetic actuation, image processing, medical imaging, and closed-loop control systems, such as the dual-robotic arm integrating ultrasound imaging and magnetic actuation, C-arm fluoroscopy and magnetic actuation.

        **Peer Reviewer:** IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics (T-Mech), IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), and Research.
